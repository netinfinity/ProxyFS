This file will track the ongoing API & Internal changes that are, at the time, still needed
===========================================================================================

Specific API changes:

It looks like the API changes you are describing are for a hypothetical "/.snapshot" directory.  Many, but
not all of these changes apply to all files and directories on the snapshot.

We need a notion of a Read-only file system.  Snapshots are read-only, but other file systems could become
read-only (or disabled) as a result of storage updates or otherwise.  As far as Access() and other modifying
operations are concerned, the correct error is EROFS (Read Only FileSystem), and not EPERM (Permissions failure).

Changes required in fetchOnDiskInode()/headhunter:

Done?  Notifications
-----  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
       vS.headhunterVolumeHandle.GetInodeRec(uint64(inodeNumber)) call needs to consult appropriate SnapShot
  Y    Research why a fetched inode is initially marked Dirty?
  -      In short, we see no reason for it... so making the change to no longer do it now.
       Need to make it "easy" for SnapShotDeleteByFSLayer() to delete all inodeCache elements with that SnapShot ID
